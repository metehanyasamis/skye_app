# Overview

Insert overview text here. The agent will only see this should they choose to apply the rule.

code-style-and-architecture
- use flutter best practices
- keep widgets small and focused
- avoid duplicated ui; extract reusable widgets
- prefer composition over inheritance
- keep business logic out of ui widgets

ui-and-design
- follow figma designs strictly
- do not change spacing, colors, or typography unless requested
- use custom widgets for repeated patterns (buttons, cards, headers)
- animations must be subtle and performant (no jank)

navigation-and-state
- keep navigation logic centralized

performance
- avoid unnecessary rebuilds
- use const constructors where possible
- do not block ui thread
- animations must be <= 300ms unless specified

assets-and-theming
- do not hardcode colors; use AppColors
- use app typography consistently

naming-and-structure
- use lowercase_with_underscores for files
- use clear, descriptive names
- keep folder structure feature-based

communication
- do not refactor unless explicitly asked
- if unsure, ask before changing architecture
- explain only what changed and why
